## Common Questions About Family Massage

**Q: Is family massage safe for everyone?**

Consult with a healthcare professional before performing massage on individuals with certain medical conditions, such as cancer, heart disease, or pregnancy. The course covers safety guidelines and contraindications in detail.

**Q: Do I need any special equipment for family massage?**

A: You don't need any fancy equipment. A comfortable massage environment, some massage oil or lotion, and a few towels or pillows are all you need to get started.

**Q: How long should a family massage session last?**
